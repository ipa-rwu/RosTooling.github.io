# Create your model

You can create a new file with the extension .ros2 in the rosnodes folder from the previously created [project](LearnRosModels.md) by right-clicking in the folder and selecting New -> File. 

This will create an empty file where you can create your model. As a helper, you can use the [reference documentation](RosModelDescription.md) and press Ctrl + Space bar to use the auto-complete functionality.

If auto-complete or the grammar highlighting is not working, check that the file is open with the "Ros 2 Editor" with a right-click on the file and under "Open with..".
